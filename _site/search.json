      "contents": "\r\nHi, welcome to our group project website for visual analytics. Our\r\ngroup consist of Ting Yen-Hsin, He Qiyun and Ng Jianyuan Caine.\r\nThis project is about building a visual analytics app to enable a\r\nchain of department stores to analyse and perform clustering with time\r\nseries data.\r\nAbstract\r\nData for transactions at convenience stores or eCommerce websites are\r\nfreely available online for students and analysts to practice their\r\nskills to derive insights. A common approach would be to use\r\nunsupervised learning techniques such as k-means clustering or\r\nhierarchical clustering to group data together before further analyzing\r\nthe groups for the unique traits. However, possibility due to complexity\r\nor requirement for specialized enterprise software clustering of time\r\nseries data is seldom done.\r\nThe availability of R package dtwclust has allowed access to perform\r\ntime series clustering without significant cost. However, does require\r\nsome familiarity with R code to access functions in the packages.\r\nIn this project we wish to demonstrate how a customized R Shiny\r\napplication would allow users without deep technical capabilities to\r\nperform analysis on their time series data and to group different\r\nattributes along their time series data before further analysis into\r\ntheir group characteristics.\r\nThe data set chosen for this project consist of time series data from\r\nseries of Favorita department stores located in Ecuador found here.\r\nThe focus of this project will be to develop an interactive visual\r\nanalysis app that would allow the manager of the chain department stores\r\nto perform a time series analysis on store sales and group attributes\r\nbased on time series patterns before further inspecting the data along\r\ngenerated groups.\r\nUsing appropriate time series visualizations such as horizon plots\r\nusers could compare difference and observe seasonal trends. Clustering\r\ncould then be performed along different categorical variables. Results\r\nare then return in relevant graphs for results inspection. Based on\r\ngroups appropriate dashboard is generated for users to deep dive into\r\nthe data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
